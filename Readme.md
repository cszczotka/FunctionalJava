## **FunctionalJava**
This project demonstrate functional programing concept translated to Java language:

 - Pure function

 - High ordered function

 - Function composition
 
 - Referential transparency

 - Currying

 - Partial composition

 - Avoid null - optional

 - Monad
 
 - IOMonad
  
 - Handling side effect functionally ( laziness and monad )

Pure function:
- has a single responisiblity
- has no side effect
- is referentially transparent

Monads.
- Monads are computational context
- They are parametrized type
- They have unit function to put a value inside
- They have a bind function to apply a function to transform the value
